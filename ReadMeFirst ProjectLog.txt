When i want to update script, the desktop software cannot find device even developer and usb debuging mode turn on.
I just trying to complete this script, i want to know i still can get new idea or not.
But now they cannot connect, i think is the time to stop this project. 
Maybe the problem is the Memu and Anjian update then cannot support.

v2 run on MEmu got some bug, anjian will auto close, it seems like crash, but run on win10 pro may not easy crash.
